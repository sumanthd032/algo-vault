## 🧭 Project Structure

The repository is structured into folders based on **algorithm design techniques**. Each folder contains:

- ✅ C++ implementation of each algorithm
- 📄 Descriptive pdf files
- 🧠 Explanation of logic, use cases, time and space complexity

## 📂 Folder Breakdown

| Category              | Description                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Greedy`              | Algorithms that make locally optimal choices (e.g. Prim's, Dijkstra)|
| `DynamicProgramming`  | Problems solved by breaking them into overlapping subproblems       |
| `Backtracking`        | Exhaustive search with recursion and pruning                       |
| `BranchAndBound`      | Optimized exhaustive search using bounds to eliminate subtrees      |
| `BruteForce`          | Simple and straightforward approaches without optimization          |
| `DecreaseAndConquer`  | Problems solved by reducing input size one step at a time           |
